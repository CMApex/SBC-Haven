This is a website I made and am updating as time goes on with a focus on a hobbyist interest of mine - Single Board Computers. I think there's not a very good place aggregating basic information on these types of PCs online and I wanted to begin this long term project of setting up my own blog style website for the purpose of sharing my interest and helping others interested to have a place to get started with diving into the hobby.
