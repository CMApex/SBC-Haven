        <h2>Ideas for applications</h2>
            <p>The newest option in the list! This successor to the infinitely popular Raspberry Pi 4 is an absolute juggernaut of power. If you can think of it this SBC can keep up with it. From server based tasks, to emulating the usage of a microcontroller
                to game emulation all the way up to the Nintendo GameCube and Sony Playstation 2, to even usages in robotics and other forms of engineering. The only reason this absolute beast of an SBC isn't getting the SBC Haven stamp of approval is they are perpetually out of stock due to their popularity.
                We don't believe those interested in this hobby should have to resort to paying scalper prices so we suggest holding off until they're more readily in stock.
