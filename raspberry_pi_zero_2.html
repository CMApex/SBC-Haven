        <h2>Ideas for applications</h2>
            <p>At only 15 dollars this is by far the cheapest option in the list, which may make you think that it would be what we here at SBC Haven would recommend for a beginner. That's not the case, as we feel That
                low powered SBCs like this are best saved for more advanced projects. The Raspberry Pi Zero has earned a name for itself in a number of hobbyist ethical hacking projects as well as in the robotics field. It works as a wonderful microcontroller
                for external machines. We here at SBC Haven certainly do recommend Raspberry Pi's smallest option, but not for your first Single Board Computer. That honor goes to the Raspberry Pi 4 which you can get more information on in the link above.
